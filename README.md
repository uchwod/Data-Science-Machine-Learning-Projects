This project involves implementing and analyzing the performance of different reinforcement learning agents in a multi-armed bandit environment. A multi-armed bandit problem is a classic scenario in reinforcement learning where an agent must choose between multiple actions (or "arms"), each with unknown rewards, to maximize its total reward over time.
